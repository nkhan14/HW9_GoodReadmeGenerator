## Installation
There are many steps involved. The biggest is the npm stuff. You will need to do npm init and npm i for inquirer, axios, and readline. This is the bulk of it. Then its just looking at all the ways the packages are and making an index.js. 

## Usage
You need to be in the proper folder. Then run terminal. Then command the following line: "node index.js" . Then you need to answer the questions. Simple!

## Contributors
There are none. 

## Test
Just test it out by running it and see if it works. If there is an error, let me know!

## Questions
If you have any questions, contact undefined on GitHub.
